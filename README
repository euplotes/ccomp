CCOMP

Copyright (c) 2006 Piotr Rotkiewicz

CCOMP is a simple command-line tool for comparing ligand/receptor complexes.

The program can also be used for calculating pairwise all-atom RMSD of slightly
different protein structures, taking care of missing atoms, sequence
inconsistencies, etc. CCOMP reads two files in PDB format, including both
a receptor and a ligand, computes a pairwise sequence alignment of the receptor
molecules, generates alpha-carbon superposition of the receptor structures
according to the generated alignment, and computes individual deviations per
residue. Additionally, several statistical measures are calculated.
